# note

the introduction map is actually a combination of two backups that I made of the map. expect the easy diff to be unfinished

the reason that it's two backups instead of what ended up being the last revision is because I lost the original map

as for the murmur twins one, I actually made another diff, but I lost it. this is the only one of the two diffs that I made that I still have
