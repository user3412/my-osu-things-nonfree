# Information

The skins in this folder aren't known for being used by one specific player, but are hard to find or is just interesting. Thanks to Worst HRplayer 2 for still having the sakamata chloe dt skin! (the reddit post was deleted and mega can't decode the other file (prob the dt version), so I'm lucky that someone uses that as their main skin (it could be a different skin, but it doesn't matter)
